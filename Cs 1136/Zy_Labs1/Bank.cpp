/*

Now we want to convert the following pseudocode into a program

Display "Enter the starting balance"
Input balance
Display "Enter total deposits"
Input deposits
Display "Enter total withdrawals"
Input withdrawals
Store the value of balance plus deposits minus withdrawals in variable endingBalance
Display "The ending balance is " endingBalance

   double balance, deposits, withdrawals, endingBalance;

   // Get the starting balance
   cout << "Enter the starting balance" << endl;
   cin >> balance;

   // Get the withdrawals
