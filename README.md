##### More About Semester 2
In the latter half of my freshman year at UTD, I took 2 classes relating to programming, CS 1336 and CS 1136. Although these are beginner courses 
I learned more then I ever thought I would because these classes also introduced me to CPP, which is throughougly enjoy for its simplicity yet abundance of material to digest.
