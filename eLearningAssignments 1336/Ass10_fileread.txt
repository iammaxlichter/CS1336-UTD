These destinations will inspire even the most experienced aurora chaser!!!!!.
The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, are a spectacular 
natural light show visible at certain times of the year in the northern hemisphere. 
This phenomenon occurs when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the 
Earth's atmosphere and collide with gaseous particles, such as oxygen and nitrogen. 
The experience is surreal, with vibrant hues of blue, green, pink and violet 
dancing across the night sky. The best places to see the aurora borealis offer 
little to no light pollution, clear skies and no precipitation. Many top viewing 
spots have websites with aurora trackers and staff members at some hotels will wake up visitors 
when the lights appear (if reuested). Read on to discover the top destinations 
where you can see the kaleidoscopic northern lights.
